Open Chrome v. 6.0.472.0What is the expected result?1. Chrome's user interface and the webpages should scale with the high dpi setting.What happens instead?1. The native (non-scaled) interface is shown and the pages need to be manually zoomed in order to increase their size.example: before the new dev release with the issue, google.com is usable and readable on my screen when Windows is set at 149dpi and 100% (default) zoom.  After the issue, I need to manually zoom beyond 100% so it is displayed the same size as the previous Chrome version when it was set at 100%.2. Both the interface AND the rendered page show the issue.Please provide any additional information below. Attach a screenshot ifpossible.1. Reverting to the latest beta release resolved the issue (5.0.375.99 (Official Build 51029) beta.2. Selecting and deselecting \"disable display scaling on high dpi settings\" did not change the behavior of Chrome when 6.0.472 was installed.3. The \"disable display scaling...\" option was always deselected when Chrome was working properly.4. every other program on my computer is displaying properly with the high dpi setting  the latest dev release 6.0.472.0 is the first in a long time (~1 year+?) which didn't work properly at high Windows dpi.\"\"\"\n",
